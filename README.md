# Tweeter_Text_Classification

We performed sentiment analysis on a dataset consisting of 1600000 tweets (800000 Positive and 800000 Negative) taken from Kaggle. We performed data cleaning using regex. We then tokenized the tweets and performed the stemming process using Snowball stemmer. We performed word embedding using GloVe for vectorized representation of words. Model training is done using LSTM which is an artificial neural network algorithm used in Deep learning. LSTM model consists of an Embedding layer, Bidirectional layer, Dropout layer, and Dense layer. We used ADAM optimizer and Accuracy metric to monitor the performance of our model. We saved our model in .h5 file format to store weights and model configuration. Streamlit library is used to make an interactive web app of our model. We used the AWS platform to deploy our model. We also visualized the data results using matplotlib and seaborn.
